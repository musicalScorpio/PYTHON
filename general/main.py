7-8. Deli: Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various sandwiches. 
Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches. Loop through the list of sandwich orders and print a message 
for each order, such as I made your tuna sandwich. As each sandwich is made, move it to the list of finished 
sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing each sandwich that was made.

'''
'''
7-9. No Pastrami: Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code near the beginning of 
your program to print a message saying the deli has run out of pastrami, 
and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches.

7-10. Dream Vacation: Write a program that polls users about their dream vacation. Write a prompt similar to If you could 
visit one place in the world, where would you go? Include a block of code that prints the results of the poll.
